Research Experiences
======

**Research Assistant**(2019.02 - Present)<br>
At Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR).<br>
*Advised by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/).*<br>
Mainly on adversarial robustness, generalization theory, and NeuralODE. We have proposed a generalization error estimate from Neural ODE perspective and have explained properties of adversarial examples via neural tangent kernel. Currently we are considering the influence on model robustness of injecting different randomness in model and training process. 

## Other Course Projects
* *2019*  Combining traditional energy-based methods with virtual adversarial training in semi-supervised learning:<br>
  We proposed a new perspective to formulate the regularization effects that virtual adversarial training(VAT) impose during training process. In this view point, connection between traditional energy methods and VAT can be bridged and several modification are made to the VAT. We also have further ideas on designing new regularization and it is still an ongoing work.
* *2019*  Long-term Traffic Flow Prediction: <br>
  We investigate and implement various influencial models for traffic forecasting and networks for temporal graphs. Based on previous studies, we optimize the networks structure and make modification for 3D-convolution-based and WaveNet-based methods, improving their results on real world dataset.
* *2018*  Algorithms for Large-Scale Optimal Transport: <br>
  In this work, we combine Newton Method and Sinkhorn Iteration into a faster and more stable algorithm.
