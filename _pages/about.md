I am a junior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University(PKU), majoring in Information and Computing Science. My advisor is Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). I am interested in machine learning in general, but especially in adversarial robustness, causality and interpretability, and semi-supervised learning. I am devoted to developing more robust, interpretable methods for machine learning and I also believe my mathematical background can help to guide the design of such methods. <br>
My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Pure Math and Applied Math of my school.

I am looking for research internship this summer.

Research Experiences
======

## Machine Learning Theory


**Research Assistant**(2019.02 - Present)<br>
At Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR).<br>
*Advised by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/).*<br>
Mainly on adversarial robustness, generalization theory, and NeuralODE. We have proposed a generalization error estimate from Neural ODE perspective and have explained properties of adversarial examples via neural tangent kernel. Currently we are considering the influence on model robustness of injecting different randomness in model and training process. 

## Other Course Projects
* *2019*  Combining traditional energy-based methods with virtual adversarial training in semi-supervised learning:<br>
  We proposed a new perspective to formulate the regularization effects that virtual adversarial training(VAT) impose during training process. In this view point, connection between traditional energy methods and VAT can be bridged and several modification are made to the VAT. We also have further ideas on designing new regularization and it is still an ongoing work.
* *2019*  Long-term Traffic Flow Prediction: <br>
  We investigate and implement various influencial models for traffic forecasting and networks for temporal graphs. Based on previous studies, we optimize the networks structure and make modification for 3D-convolution-based and WaveNet-based methods, improving their results on real world dataset.
* *2018*  Algorithms for Large-Scale Optimal Transport: <br>
  In this work, we combine Newton Method and Sinkhorn Iteration into a faster and more stable algorithm.

Less-serious Life
======
Sports is an essential thing in my life, bringing me lots of happiness and passion which take me forward and forward.
* *I am keen on tennis and become a 3.0 tennis player this year, according to the NTRP standards.*
* *I am a wall-climbing jock and earn 99/100 in climbing course. I enjoy the accomplishment brought by finding ways to keep balance and to use every muscle to reach my targets.*
* *Hiking, swimming...*
