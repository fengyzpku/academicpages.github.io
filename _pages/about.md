I am a junior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University(PKU), majoring in Information and Computing Science. My advisor is [Prof. Bin Dong](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Pure Math and Applied Math of my school. I am interested in machine learning in general, but especially in robustness, causality and interpretability, generalization, and semi-supervised learning. I am devoted to developing more robust, interpretable methods for deep learning and I also believe my mathematical background can help to guide the design of such methods. 

I am looking for research intern next summer.

Research Experience
======
### Machine Learning Theory


**Research Assistant**(2019.02 til now) at Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR).<br>
*Advised by [Prof. Bin Dong](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/).*<br>
Mainly on Adversarial Robustness, Generalization theory, and NeuralODE. Currently we are considering the influence of different randomness in training process on the model robustness. 

### Other Course Projects
* Combining traditional energy-based methods with virtual adversarial training in semi-supervised learning.
* Long-term traffic flow forecasting model using 3D convolution and WaveNet.

Less-serious Life
======
Sports is an essential thing in my life, bringing me lots of happiness and passion which take me forward and forward.
* *I am keen on tennis and become a 3.0 tennis player this year, according to the NTRP standards.*
* *I am a wall-climbing jock and earn 99/100 in climbing course. I enjoy the accomplishment brought by finding ways to keep balance and to use every muscle to reach my targets.*
* *Hiking, swimming...*
