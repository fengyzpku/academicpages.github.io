I am a PhD Student at the Center for Data Science, New York University, where I am in the Math and Data group and work with Prof. [Julia Kempe](https://cims.nyu.edu/~kempe/). I am generally interested in improving inference beyond standard IID settings, including complex data with inner structures, distributional shift, and endogeneity. I hope to provide efficient methods and methodology guidance by leveraging my background in applied math, statistics, and computer science. I am now interested in data distillation/pruning and am working on its connection with pretrained image encoder, cooperating with Dr. [Ramakrishna Vedantam](https://vrama91.github.io/). I am also working on evaluating the robustness of Out of Distribution Detection pipelines with Dr. [Tim G. J. Rudner](https://timrudner.com/).

I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics (Honor Track) at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. Back then, I was advised by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/) on adversarial robustness. In Summer 2020, I worked virtually with Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard on high dimensional statistics and machine learning. I also worked closely with Dr. [Di He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dihe/) from Microsoft Research Asia on representation. In 2022 Summer, I interned at Uber as an Applied Scientist Intern on causal machine learning.

More about myself: I am an outdoor lover. I climbed the Luodui Mount (6010m Snowberg) at Tibet, China in August, 2021. I have also served as the teaching assistant of *Outdoor Exploration* at Peking University. Outdoor experiences really help shape my personality and life methodology.
