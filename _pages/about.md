I am a PhD candidate in the Math and Data group at the Center for Data Science, New York University, under the supervision of Prof. [Julia Kempe](https://cims.nyu.edu/~kempe/). Alongside Prof. Kempe, I am fortunate to have the support of my committee advisors, Prof. [Qi Lei](https://cecilialeiqi.github.io/) and Prof. [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). I have been fortunate to work with Dr. [Yann Ollivier](http://www.yann-ollivier.org/)(Meta) during my internship at FAIR, Meta.

My current research interests focus on several key areas: 1) improved methods for scientific reasoning, 2) reinforcement learning and test-time optimization, 3) the impact of AI-synthesized data on contemporary learning paradigms. By drawing upon my theoretical knowledge and practical experience, I aim to contribute insightful understandings and develop robust methodologies in these areas.

I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics (Honor Track) at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. Back then, I was advised by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/) on adversarial robustness. In Summer 2020, I worked virtually with Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard on high dimensional statistics and machine learning. I also worked closely with Dr. [Di He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dihe/) from Microsoft Research Asia on representation. In 2022 Summer, I interned at Uber as an Applied Scientist Intern on causal machine learning.

More about myself: I am an outdoor lover. I climbed the Luodui Mount (6010m Snowberg) at Tibet, China in August, 2021. I have also served as the teaching assistant of *Outdoor Exploration* at Peking University. Outdoor experiences really help shape my personality and life methodology.
