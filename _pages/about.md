I am a PhD Student at the Center for Data Science, New York University, where I am in the Math and Data group and work with Prof. [Julia Kempe](https://cims.nyu.edu/~kempe/). I am generally interested in improving inference beyond standard IID settings, including complex data with inner structures, distributional shift, and endogeneity. I hope to provide efficient methods and methodology guidance by leveraging my background in applied math, statistics, and computer science. I am now interning at Uber Technologies on heterogeneous data with marketplace interference and distributional shift with Causal Machine Learning.

Before joining NYU, I did my undergraduate in Applied Mathematics (Honor Track) at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I really enjoyed working with Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/) on the theory behind adversarial robustness. I spent a great summer working virtually with Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) at SEAS, Harvard University on high dimensional statistics and machine learning. I also worked closely with Dr. [Di He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dihe/) from Microsoft Research Asia on representation.

More about myself: I am an outdoor lover. I climbed the Luodui Mount (6010m Snowberg) at Tibet, China in August, 2021. I have also served as the teaching assistant of *Outdoor Exploration* at Peking University. Outdoor experiences really help shape my personality and life methodology.
