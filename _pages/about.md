I am a junior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, majoring in Information and Computing Science. My advisor is [Prof. Bin Dong](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Pure Math and Applied Math of my school. I am interested in machine learning in general, but especially in robustness, interpretability, generalization and semi-supervised learning. I am devoted to developing more robust, interpretable methods for deep learning and I also believe my mathematical background can help to guide the design of such methods. 

I am looking for research intern next summer.
