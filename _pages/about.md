I am a senior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University (PKU), majoring in Information and Computing Science. My advisor is Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). I am interested in machine learning theory in general, but especially in adversarial robustness, statistical learning theory, and semi-supervised learning. I aim to understand the theories behind current data-driven machine learning and, in return, use them to guide the designs of reliable models and algorithms. I enjoy working with Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard on the intersection between statistical physics and machine learning. I also work with Dr. He Di at Microsoft Research Asia and Prof. Liwei Wang (PKU) on representation in deep learning.
My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Applied Mathematics, PKU.


I am now applying for PhD programs of 2021 Fall. If youâ€™re interested, please do not hesitate to contact me!
