I am an incoming PhD Student at Center for Data Science, New York University and Prof. [Julia Kempe](https://cims.nyu.edu/~kempe/) will be my advisor. I will be graduating from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University (PKU) in July, 2021. My current major is Applied Mathematics and my advisor is Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). I am interested in statistical learning theory in general. 
My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Applied Mathematics, PKU.
