I am a senior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University(PKU), majoring in Information and Computing Science. My advisor is Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). I am interested in machine learning in general, but especially in adversarial robustness, causality, and semi-supervised learning. I am devoted to developing more robust, interpretable methods for machine learning and I also believe my mathematical background can help to guide the design of such methods. Currently, I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) on theoretically understanding machine learning with statistial physics and random matrix theory.<br> 
My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Pure Math and Applied Math of my school.

I will be applying for PhD program in this year.

Research Experiences
======

## Machine Learning Theory


**Research Assistant**(2019.02 - Present)<br>
At Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research(BICMR).<br>
*Advised by Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/).*<br>
Mainly on adversarial robustness, generalization theory, and NeuralODE. We have proposed a generalization error estimate from Neural ODE perspective and have explained properties of adversarial examples via neural tangent kernel. 

**Summer Research Intern**(2020.07 - present)<br>
*Advised by Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/)

## Other Course Projects
* *2019*  Combining traditional energy-based methods with virtual adversarial training in semi-supervised learning:<br>
  We proposed a new perspective to formulate the regularization effects that virtual adversarial training(VAT) impose during training process. In this view point, connection between traditional energy methods and VAT can be bridged and several modification are made to the VAT. We also have further ideas on designing new regularization and it is still an ongoing work.
* *2019*  Long-term Traffic Flow Prediction: <br>
  We investigate and implement various influencial models for traffic forecasting and networks for temporal graphs. Based on previous studies, we optimize the networks structure and make modification for 3D-convolution-based and WaveNet-based methods, improving their results on real world dataset.
* *2018*  Algorithms for Large-Scale Optimal Transport: <br>
  In this work, we combine Newton Method and Sinkhorn Iteration into a faster and more stable algorithm.

Publications
======

(Preprint) [Transferred Discrepancy: Quantifying the Difference Between Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12446).*<br>
**Yunzhen Feng***, Runtian Zhai*, Di He, Liwei Wang, Bin Dong<br>
Understanding what information neural networks capture is an essential problem in deep learning, and studying whether different models capture similar features is an initial step to achieve this goal. Unlike previous works, we propose a novel metric that defines the difference between two representations based on their downstream-task performance. With this metric, experiments show that for models trained from different initializations, the learned features are not same. We also find that TD may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies: a training strategy that leads to more robust representation also trains models that generalize better.

(Preprint) [Enhancing Certified Robustness of Smoothed Classifiers via Weighted Model Ensembling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09363).*<br>
Chizhou Liu, **Yunzhen Feng**, Ranran Wang, Bin Dong<br>
Randomized smoothing has achieved state-of-the-art certified robustness against l2-norm adversarial attacks. However, it is not wholly resolved on how to find the optimal base classifier for randomized smoothing. In this work, we employ a Smoothed WEighted ENsembling (SWEEN) scheme to improve the performance of randomized smoothed classifiers. Theoretical results on how SWEEN can be trained to achieve near-optimal risk in the randomized smoothing regime, an adaptive prediction algorithm to reduce the prediction and certification cost are proposed. Extensive experiments illustrates the benefits of employing SWEEN.

Less-serious Life
======
Sports is an essential thing in my life, bringing me lots of happiness and passion which take me forward and forward.
* *I am keen on tennis and become a 3.0 tennis player this year, according to the NTRP standards.*
* *I am a wall-climbing jock and earn 99/100 in climbing course. I enjoy the accomplishment brought by finding ways to keep balance and to use every muscle to reach my targets.*
* *Hiking, swimming...*
