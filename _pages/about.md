I am a senior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University(PKU), majoring in Information and Computing Science. My advisor is Prof. [Bin Dong](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~dongbin/). I am interested in machine learning in general, but especially in adversarial robustness, causality, and semi-supervised learning. I am devoted to developing more robust, interpretable methods for machine learning and I also believe my mathematical background can help to guide the design of such methods. Currently, I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Yue M. Lu](https://lu.seas.harvard.edu/) on theoretically understanding machine learning with statistial physics and random matrix theory.<br> 
My research and study are supported by the Elite Undergraduate Training Program of Pure Math and Applied Math of my school.

I will be applying for PhD programs in this year.
